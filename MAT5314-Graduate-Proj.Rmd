# Introduction

## 1)
### what causes earthquake

### why it is difficult to predict

## 2)
### how do others analyze this data? what are the methods so far

Frequent historical earthquakes give us a huge data set that can be used to study earthquake causes, correlations, space-time, and further earthquake prediction. Several statistical models can be applied to the analysis of earthquake processes. Trigger model, a special case of the Neyman-Scott clustering model, can be used to estimate aftershocks after a major earthquake. Epidemic-Type Aftershocks Earthquake (ETAS) model is also widely used to forecast earthquake occurrences. People perform time series analysis to explore cycles related to earthquake frequency. Deep learning provides us the prediction of seismic events, including intensity and location. Clustering model can identify regions with high-frequency earthquakes to upgrade building structures to reduce damage from impending earthquakes.

## 3)
### why do we want to analyze this data (to draw some inference? to predict? to check model legitimacy?)

# Method

## visualization of data

## time series analysis

## location analysis (cluster analysis?)

## In-depth exploration of the data using longitude/lattitude/magnitude

# Result

# Discussion

# Conclusion
