# MAT5314-Graduate-Proj

This is a graduate project on the topic of analyzing earthquake data.

We focus on a data set of earthquake occurrence in Canada provided by the Government of Canada.

Goals:
- In this project we want to analyze the data to give a detailed review of this natural disaster in the country and make some inference about its characteristics. 

- In particular, we want to check if there's any location-wise pattern in earthquake occurrence and how frequent it can happen. 

- Then we want to analyze if the occurrence of earthquake is also correlated to some other variables such as seasonality. 

- Finally we want to apply some probabilistic model that have been extensively studies by other researchers to the data in order to assess the counts of future occurrence.

Timelines:
- Duration for the entire semester.

- Weekly meeting schedule: every Friday night on Teams.

- First month: Data exploration and gaining general knowledge of seismic activity.

- Second month: Build data definition and make exploratory analysis including graphics and tables.

- Third month: Time series analysis

- Fourth month: implement an improved stochastic process model found from a recent research paper on the data.
